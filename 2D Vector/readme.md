# 2D Vector
## Description:
### Attributes:
- private double x --> X coordinate
- private double y --> Y coordinate
### Constructors:
- Vector (double xValue , double yValue) --> Assign X , Y to vector
### Methods:
- double mag() --> Get Magnitude of the vector
- void print() --> Print the vector in rectangle form
- Vector add(Vector v) --> Add two vectors and return address of new vector which is the result
- Vector sub(Vector v) --> Sub two vectors and return address of new vector which is the result
- static double average(Vector [] arr) --> Static Method to get Average of Magnitudes of array of Vectors
